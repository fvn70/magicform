## About
Every good site has an online form to fill out â€” whether for registering, ordering food,  or making payments. Forms can be very large; if you accidentally reload a page, you can lose all the data. A sad story, isn't it? To resolve this, let's create a form that will retain the data, when it closes unexpectedly.
